Loan
Secure Bank allows users to apply for loans and repay them through EMI. Document submission is mandatory for loan applicants. Users can also track their loan transactions.
Admins have the authority to approve or reject loans based on the documents uploaded during the application process. 
Additionally, a credit score is generated for each user, which the loan officer (admin) uses to decide whether to approve or reject the loan.
